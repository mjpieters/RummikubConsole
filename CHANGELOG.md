## [1.2.1] - 2021-04-09

### Fixed

- Tile displays should no longer end up wider than the terminal width.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-03-26

- New 'check' command validates the table, shows a possible set arrangement and shows if any placed jokers can be freely used for other purposes without invalidating the table tile arrangement.

## [1.1.2] - 2021-03-25

### Fixed

- Do not crash when clearing an empty rack or table.


## [1.1.1] - 2021-03-22

## [1.1.0] - 2021-03-22

### Changed

### Fixed

- Minor changes to the contents of the package distribution (removing some surplus dev-only files).

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-20

### Added

- Compact tile group and run notation in commands; a colour followed by two numbers separated by a dash (`k3-6`) expands to a run of tiles (here, `k3`, `k4`, `k5` and `k6`), and multiple colour letters followed by a number (e.g. `bro8`) expands into a group (`b8`, `r8` and `o8`). 
- Added a 'version' command and improved the help system.

### Fixed

- readline column handling at the command prompt no longer is thrown off by ANSI colour codes.
- Include sets with jokers in runs longer than the minimum length, where the joker is not first or last.
- In rulesets where the number of jokers matched the number of number repeats per colour, the solver would not restrict the number of jokers used. This was not really an issue as the contents of the rack already placed a stricter constraint.


## [1.0.0b3] - 2021-03-19

### Fixed

## [1.0.0b2] - 2021-03-19

### Fixed

## [1.0.0b1] - 2021-03-19

### Added
