    Builds on the approach described by D. Den Hertog, P. B. Hulshof,
    Solving Rummikub Problems by Integer Linear Programming, The Computer
    Journal, Volume 49, Issue 6, November 2006, Pages 665â€“669,
    https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxl033

    Adapted to work with different Rummikub rule sets, including having
    a different number of possible jokers from repeated number tiles within
    the same colour, as well as much better initial tile placement and
    joker handling in general.

    Creates cvxpy solvers *once* and use parameters to improve efficiency.
